I am a graduate of Games Computing from the University of Lincoln.

I am self-motivated and conscientious, and pride myself on being able to use my own initiative and am open to new experiences. I am flexible and adaptable in my own approach to work as well as being able to work under pressure, to tight deadlines and within set budgets, and am able to work effectively alone or as part of a team.

In my spare time I have been working on personal projects to keep my skills up to date, including former University work.
